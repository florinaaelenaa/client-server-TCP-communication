Implementing a file system for saving and sharing files in the network.

There are 2 entities involved:
- the server: ./server <port_server> <users_config_file> <static_shares_config_file> 
- the client: ./client <IP_server> <port_server>

<users_config_file> users that are in the system
<static_shares_config_file> files shared by the users

The communication is made via TCP.

The client can request different commands:
- login <name> <password>
- logout
- getuserlist
- getfilelist <user_name>
- upload <file>
- download <user_name> <file>
- share <file>
- unshare <file>
- delete <file>
- quit (this ends the session)

The server can request just the quit command
